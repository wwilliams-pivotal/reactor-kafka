    gradle

### Building a jar and running it ###
    ./gradlew jar

### Running unit tests ###

### Building IDE project ###
    ./gradlew eclipse
    ./gradlew idea

See [reactor-kafka-samples/src/main/java/reactor/kafka/samples/SampleProducer.java](reactor-kafka-samples/src/main/java/reactor/kafka/samples/SampleProducer.java) for sample reactive producer.
See [reactor-kafka-samples/src/main/java/reactor/kafka/samples/SampleConsumer.java](reactor-kafka-samples/src/main/java/reactor/kafka/samples/SampleConsumer.java) for sample reactive producer.

2. Compile and run reactor.kafka.samples.SampleProducer (eg. from IDE as a Java application))

#### To run sample consumer: ####
1. Update BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS and TOPIC in SampleConsumer.java if required
2.  Run reactor.kafka.samples.SampleConsumer (eg. from IDE as a Java application))

#### To run GemFire sample consumer ####
1. Do all of the above except do not start SampleConsumer
2. Start a GemFire cluster with default ports with a region named regionA
